    """An area mark defined by a baseline (*x1*, *y1*) and a topline (*x2*, *y2*).

    The **x1** and **y1** channels specify the area's baseline; the **x2** and **y2** channels specify the area's topline. Both the baseline and topline are typically bound to the same scales as their respective dimensions.

    If **x2** is not specified, it defaults to **x1**. If **y2** is not specified, it defaults to **y1**. Typically either **x2** or **y2** is unspecified, creating either a horizontal or vertical area.

    Args:
       data: The data source for the mark.
       x1: The required primary (starting, often left) horizontal position channel, representing the area's baseline, typically bound to the *x* scale.
       x2: The optional secondary (ending, often right) horizontal position channel, representing the area's topline, typically bound to the *x* scale; if not specified, **x1** is used.
       y1: The required primary (starting, often bottom) vertical position channel, representing the area's baseline, typically bound to the *y* scale.
       y2: The optional secondary (ending, often top) vertical position channel, representing the area's topline, typically bound to the *y* scale; if not specified, **y1** is used.
       z: An optional ordinal channel for grouping data into (possibly stacked) series to be drawn as separate areas; defaults to **fill** if a channel, or **stroke** if a channel.
       filter_by: Selection to filter by (defaults to data source selection).
       offset: After stacking, an optional **offset** can be applied to translate and scale stacks, say to produce a streamgraph; defaults to null for a zero baseline (**y** = 0 for stackY, and **x** = 0 for stackX). If the *wiggle* offset is used, the default **order** changes to *inside-out*.
       order: The order in which stacks are layered; one of:

         - null (default) for input order
         - a named stack order method such as *inside-out* or *sum*
         - a field name, for natural order of the corresponding values
         - a function of data, for natural order of the corresponding values
         - an array of explicit **z** values in the desired order

         If the *wiggle* **offset** is used, as for a streamgraph, the default changes to *inside-out*.
